# JABAWS: Bioinformatics Web Services for Alignment and Analysis

JABAWS provides a suite of bioinformatics web services for multiple sequence alignment, protein disorder prediction, and conservation analysis â€” packaged for convenient deployment on your local computer, server, or cluster.

This resource was developed by the [Dundee Resource for Sequence Analysis and Structure Prediction](https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/drsasp.html). For more information or to use the public JABAWS server, visit the [JABAWS web server](https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jabaws/).


## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Ensure Docker is installed on your system. If needed, refer to the [Docker install docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).


### Run a Disposable Instance

To quickly try JABAWS without saving any data or configuration, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 drsasp/jabaws:latest
```

This will start the JABAWS web server and expose it at `http://localhost:8080`. The container and any changes made within it will be discarded once it stops.

### Run a Persistent Instance

Choose one of the following approaches:

**Option A: Docker-managed volumes (recommended for most users)**
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jabaws-logs:/usr/local/tomcat/logs \
  -v jabaws-jobsout:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/jabaws/jobsout \
  --name jabaws-server \
  drsasp/jabaws:latest
```

**Option B: Bind mounts (for direct file access)**
```bash
mkdir -p ./logs ./jobsout
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v "$(pwd)/logs:/usr/local/tomcat/logs" \
  -v "$(pwd)/jobsout:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/jabaws/jobsout" \
  --name jabaws-server \
  drsasp/jabaws:latest
```

### Accessing Logs and Job Outputs

To view logs:

```bash
# View live logs from the container
docker logs -f jabaws-server

# Access log files directly
docker exec jabaws-server tail -f /usr/local/tomcat/logs/catalina.out
```

To access job outputs:

```bash
# List job outputs inside the container
docker exec jabaws-server ls -la /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/jabaws/jobsout/

# Copy job outputs from container to your host
docker cp jabaws-server:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/jabaws/jobsout ./local-jobsout
```

### Volume Management

If you're using Docker-managed volumes (recommended Option A), here are some helpful commands:

```bash
# List volumes
docker volume ls
```

To back up volumes:

```bash
# Backup logs volume
docker run --rm -v jabaws-logs:/source -v $(pwd):/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/jabaws-logs-backup.tar.gz -C /source .

# Backup job outputs volume
docker run --rm -v jabaws-jobsout:/source -v $(pwd):/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/jabaws-jobsout-backup.tar.gz -C /source .
```

You can stop it with:

```bash
docker stop jabaws-server
```

And start it again with:

```bash
docker start jabaws-server
```

This setup keeps logs and job output on your host. For example, you can check logs with:

```bash
tail -f ./logs/catalina.out
```

Other logs of interest include:

```bash
# View the latest Tomcat access log
docker exec jabaws-server tail -f /usr/local/tomcat/logs/localhost_access_log.$(date +%F).txt

# Tail all .log and .txt files in the logs directory
docker exec -it jabaws-server bash -c 'tail -n 20 -f /usr/local/tomcat/logs/*.log /usr/local/tomcat/logs/*.txt'
```

You can also inspect specific log files, such as:

- `JABAWSErrorFile.log` â€” reports issues within JABAWS services
- `localhost_access_log.*.txt` â€” access logs for incoming requests
- `catalina.*.log` â€” Tomcat core logs (rotated daily)

ðŸ’¡ Tip: If using bind mounts, you can inspect these logs directly in `./logs/`.

And list completed job outputs:

```bash
ls -la ./jobsout/
```

This method is recommended for regular use or deployment on a server.


## Access the Services

Once started, JABAWS services will be available at:

**URL**: http://localhost:8080/jabaws/

Open `http://localhost:8080/jabaws/ServiceStatus` in your web browser to see the service list and status. Services are accessible via [Jalview](https://www.jalview.org) or the [JABAWS CLI](https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jabaws/getting_started.jsp#client).



## Use with Jalview 2.11

To enable Jalview to use your local JABAWS instance:

- In Jalview, open **Preferences â†’ Web Services**, and add your serverâ€™s JABAWS URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/jabaws/`)
- Run the tools via the Jalview **Web Services** menu.


## Services Provided

**Multiple Sequence Alignment**

- Clustal Omega
- Clustal W
- MAFFT
- MUSCLE
- T-Coffee
- ProbCons
- MSAProbs
- GLProbs

**Disorder Prediction**

- DisEMBL
- IUPred
- Jronn
- GlobPlot

**Conservation Analysis**

- [AACon (v1.1)](https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/aacon/)

**RNA Structure Prediction**

- RNAalifold (from the Vienna RNA package)


## Use Cases

The JABAWS Docker Image is ideal for users needing to:

- Run jobs that exceed our public server limits
- Adhere to strict data policies when working with sensitive data
- Work offline


## Slivka

From Jalview 2.12, JABAWS web services will be replaced by [Slivka](https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/slivka/). Please see our [slivka-bio Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/stuartmac/slivka-bio/general) for setup and configuration instructions.

Users looking to host bioinformatics web services for programmatic access only (e.g. via Jupyter Notebooks) are recommended to use Slivka.
